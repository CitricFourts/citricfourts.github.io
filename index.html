		</div>
		<p style=color:white; text-align: center>Social media websites nowadays are fucking boring and have no customization at all so I made this very very cool page that is not writen in notepad and that is not improvised at all and that I didn't spend 3 minutes watching a youtube tutorial to know how to do.

			<h1 style="20px; text-shadow: #000000 0px 0px 5px; text-align: center; color:white;">Ok but who are you?</h1>
				<p>I'm Dan. I am a very interesting individual!! (I sit around all day doing nothing).</p>
				<p>I consider myself to be a very laidback person. I'm not good at trying to act professional.
				<br>Like imagine on Discord being like "AAAAAAAAAAA RLZNCMWWMPZYRKX HHI HII HELLLO UwU I WUUV YOUU OK BYYEEEEE :33333333ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ’•ðŸ’•ðŸ’•" 
				<br>but writing an email being all like "Greetings Blablabla, I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. Worm regards, Xx_Dannielo117_xX"
				<br>It's quite comedic !</p>
				<p>I also fucking hate politics, it scares me and I always try to stay as far away from that as possible.
				<br>I'm super cool with LGTBQ+ people. In fact, I own a blahaj and like to dress feminine every once in a while :3
				<br>Also I'm not really good at talking to people but at the same time I can be super clingy which is a weird combination yay :D</p>
				<p>Now that we've gotten that out of the way let me briefly mention the things I like!</p>
			
			<h1 style="text-shadow: #000000 0px 0px 5px; font-family: comic sans ms">Musics!!</h1>
			
				<p>I've been doing musics for almost half of my life now and it's been a SUPER slow but kinda cool journey.</p>
				<p>My DAW of choice is FL Studio, its very good and doesn't crash every 3 seconds TRUST ME (IM BEING HELD AT GUNPOINT).</p>
				<p>My inspiration, references and influences are many, varied and keep changing all the time so I'm just going to keep it simple and say that
				<br>I like listening to metal like Metallica, Pantera or Yuyoyuppe.
                <br>I also like stuff like comercial 2000s EDM like Lady Gaga, Madonna or Katy Perry. I was a lil lad at around that time so it's kinda nostalgic for me.
				<br>Eurobeat is also a genre I like listening to a lot. I blame Initial D.
                <br>I also enjoy listening to stuff like Daft Punk and Fatboy Slim. Sampling old ass songs and making new music out of them is a work of art istg.</p>
                <p>NI also like to watch Music related videos on youtube from people that you may already know:</p>
                <p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DanWorrall">Dan Worrall</a></strong> - Incredible mixing engineer with a ton of experience with sound, knows how to explain shit, has given fire advice on his YT channel.
				<br><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Whiteseastudio">White Sea Studios</a></strong> - Another incredible mixing engineer, this one is more focused on testing (and often times exposing) plugins.
				<br><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SpectreSoundStudios">Spectre Sound Studios</a></strong> - Very loud and angry Canadian metal engineer. Fricker does not fuck around and will show you what REALLY changes the tone on a guitar amp.
				<br><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BennJordan">Benn Jordan</a></strong> - AKA The Flashbulb, dude's got a channel where he tests a fuck ton of acoustic stuff and talks about the music industry every once in a while.
				<br><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Tantacrul">Tantacrul</a></strong> - Incredible musician with a background in design. His videos are so fucking well produced that even if you have no idea what he's talking about he still manages to peak your interest.
			
			<h1 style="text-shadow: #000000 0px 0px 5px; font-family: comic sans ms">Watch shitty animes and read horrible mangas!!</h1>
			
				<p>Stuff from the 90s is cool. I vibe a lot with Slice of Life stuff but I'm also cool with the occasional fantasy setting (Frieren my beloved)</p>
			
			<h1 style="text-shadow: #000000 0px 0px 5px; font-family: comic sans ms">GAMES!!</h1>
			
				<p>I don't really game a lot lately but when I do it's usually old school type games like GTA Vice City, Need For Speed Most Wanted (THE ONE FROM 2005!!!), Half Life 1 and the original DOOM
				<br>(not because my computer is shit and cant run anything modern no not at all)
                <br>I do also enjoy the occasional shitty 2000s visual novel in 4:3 aspect ratio. I blame DDLC, which isn't even that old but oh well.</p>
			
			<h1 style="text-shadow: #000000 0px 0px 5px; font-family: comic sans ms">Make weird 3D images!!</h1>
			
				<p>Thank you<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@blenderguru"> Blender Guru </a>for allowing me to create whatever the fuck attrocity I was feeling like that day.</p>
			
			<h1 style="text-shadow: #000000 0px 0px 5px; font-family: comic sans ms">Be a lazy fuck on Discord!!</h1>
			
				<p>god I really need to work on this index</p>
