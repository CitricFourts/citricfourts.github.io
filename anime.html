		<p>But that's to be expected since <span class="sans"> the way I dress </span>and the music I make are inspired by anime</p>
			<h3>ANYWAYS here's my (Work in Progress) list on possibly all the anime I've watched yet!</h3>

			<hr class="rounded">

				<h2>Attack on titan</h2>
					<h4>Ereh</h4>

						<img src="pics/anime/lev.png"/>

			<hr class="rounded">

				<h2>Puella Magi Madoka Magica</h2>
					<h4>A very light hearted anime and not at all sad, trust me!</h4>

			<hr class="rounded">

				<h2>Initial D</h2>
					<h4>*Eurobeat Intensifies*</h4>

			<hr class="rounded">

				<h2>K-On!</h2>

					<p>So basically we have this girl named Yui and she's about to enter highschool, and her childhood friend is like "You gotta join a club" or some shit
					<br>So Yui checks out the "Light Music Club" thinking she's going to play the maracas or smth, but it's actually a neat little rock band.
					<br>Everyone in the band wanted Yui to join (she radiates hella cool energy not kidding) because if they don't get more than 3 members they're forced to disband (School's regulations).<br>
						<div style="position: relative; text-align: center; color:white; margin-left:50%; width: 240px; height: 333px; left: -120px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 20px 10px black;">
							<img src="pics/anime/yui.gif" width=240 height=auto/>
						</div>
					<br>Yui ends up buying a Les Paul Cherry Standard (Those guitars can cost fucking thousands of dollars not kidding) and she's taught by the guitarist of the previos band to play and sing
					<br>Soon enough the band's relationship begins to consolidate and they go on weird wacky adventures.
					<br>The music fucking slaps and the animations looks fucking gorgeous. Also I noticed the way they play their instruments is drawn correctly, like the guitar and piano fingering. Huge respect.<br><br>

					<p>In a nutshell, Lain is a very awkward girl and her father is the embodiment of ü§ì jkjk let me start again<br><br>

					<br>Lain recieves an email from a student that commited suicide not too long ago.
					<br>Turns out, the chick that commited suicide wasn't 100% dead since she transfered her consciousness or some shit to The Wired (The Internet but way more bizarre).
					<br>Lain starts to become more interested in computer stuff and gets caught up in some weird ass events and a bunch of cryptic shit.<br><br>
						<div style="position: relative; text-align: center; color:white; margin-left:50%; width: 480px; height: 556px; left: -240px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 20px 10px black;">

						</div>
					<br>Soon enough we find out that the line that separates The Wired and real life beggins to dissapear and a bunch of shit occurs and I don't understand this anime.
					<br>Also, the opening gives me extreme nostalgia for some reason.<br><br>
						<div style="position: relative; text-align: center; color:white; margin-left:50%; width: 560px; height: 315px; left: -280px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 20px 10px black;">

					<br>Overall I give it an 8/10.<br><br></p>

						</div>
					<p>The more realistic version of Komi Can't Communicate.
					<br>As cringy as it gets, I really like this fucking piece of anime.
					<br>Our protagonist is Tomoko: Weirdo ass girl, VERY introverted and has EXTREME social anxiety.</p>
						<div style="position: relative; text-align: center; color:white; margin-left:50%; width: 480px; height: 270px; left: -240px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 20px 10px black;">
							<img src="pics/anime/tomoko.gif" width=480 height=auto;/>
						</div>
					<p>She went on her life to somehow fuck everything up, hell she couldn't even properly talk to the only friend she had. Bitch went so crazy once she started talking to herself in the mirror.
					<br>Alright maybe I'm being WAY too harsh with the poor girl. AT LEAST she's trying to become a better person, and apparently she's succeeding at it... In the on-going manga ofc.
					<br>Apparently people didn't like the anime when it first aired because "tHaT DoeSn'T rEfleCt pEoplE wIth soCiaL anXieTy aT aLL hURR duRr" like calm tf down go watch Komi or smth.<br>
						<div style="position: relative; text-align: center; color:white; margin-left:50%; width: 720px; height: 404px; left: -360px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 20px 10px black;">
							<img src="pics/anime/mokochi.webp" width=720 height=auto/><br><br>
						</div>
					<br>As I was saying, the girl actually goes on to overcome her extreme social anxiety and makes a fuck ton of friends. She literally went from being a loner to a Harem protagonist fr.
					<br>Ah fuck we're here to talk about the anime, right... It can get relatable at times and I don't know how to feel about that. 7/10
					<br>I hope they make a season 2 of the anime because her character development in the manga is really fucking beautiful. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
