			<h3>ANYWAYS here's my (Work in Progress) small but humble list on possibly all the anime I've watched yet!</h3>

			<img src="pics/anime/TIER.png" class="shadow-thingy"/>
			<br>
			<hr class="rounded">

				<h2>Attack on titan</h2>
					<h4>Ereh</h4>
					<p>Season 1: I know where this is going! ...Season 2-4: NO THE FUCK I DON'T</p>

						<img src="pics/anime/lev.png"/>

			<hr class="rounded">

				<h2>Puella Magi Madoka Magica</h2>
					<h4>Left me heartbroken</h4>
						<div>
							<img src="pics/anime/madoka.gif" width=360; height=auto; class="shadow-thingy"/>
						</div>
					<p>Written by Gen Urobuchi, this may be one of the most beautiful and wholesome animes I've ever seen... Alright I'm getting waaay ahead of myself, let me explain:
					<br>We follow the life of a young school girl, Madoka, who's saved by a mysterious Magical girl after having entered a very weird place known as "Labyrinths"
					<br>These labyrinths are created by witches and they may be one of the most wacky bizarre things I've ever seen.</p>
						<div>
							<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/79/75/e8/7975e8b717572fc136d4c6fcfcb31d24.gif" width=640 height=auto class="shadow-thingy"/>
						</div>
					<p>After being saved by a magical girl, a cute little cat-like creature known as "Kyubey" gives Madoka the chance to become a Magical Girl! ...
					<br>Alright on a serious note now, Gen Urobuchi is NOT your usual scriptwriter. He wrote shit like Fate/Zero and Psycho-Pass.
					<br>People nicknamed him Uro-butcher for a reason, so you can kind of guess what kind of anime Madoka Magica is... </p>
						<div>
							<img src="https://media.tenor.com/04QDEmBKZAEAAAAC/sayaka-miki-sad.gif" width=480 height=auto class="shadow-thingy"/>
						</div>
					<p>The animation is beautiful as fuck (tho it can get kinda low cost at times) and the soundtrack is SO GOOD.
					<br>Legit everytime I get new headphones I test them with Madoka music.
					<br>Also the Rebelion movies left me questioning my existance, and Magia Record: Side Story was hella amazing too!
					<br>ANYWAYS it's a fucking amazing anime and I recommend it for everyone. Fucking 10/10</p>

			<hr class="rounded">

				<h2>K-On!</h2>
					<h4>Got me into anime</h4>
						<div>
							<img src="pics/anime/yui.gif" width=240 height=auto class="shadow-thingy"/>
						</div>
					<p>So basically we have this girl named Yui, she's about to enter highschool and her childhood friend is like "You gotta join a club" or some shit.
					<br>So Yui checks out the "Light Music Club" thinking she's going to play the maracas or smth, but it's actually a neat little rock band.
					<br>Everyone in the band wanted Yui to join (she radiates hella cool energy not kidding) because if they don't get more than 3 members they're forced to disband (School's regulations).<br>
						<div>
							<img src="pics/anime/ho.gif" width=480 height=auto class="shadow-thingy"/>
						</div>
					<br>Yui ends up buying a Les Paul Cherry Standard (Those guitars can cost thousands of dollars) and she's taught by the guitarist of the previos band to play and sing
					<br>Soon enough the band's relationship begins to consolidate and they go on weird wacky adventures.<br>
					<br>OH YEAH I forgot to mention the rest of the band lmao</p>

					<h5>Mio - Bass, very introverted but lovable character / Ritsu - Drums, she's very goofy and funny
					<br>Mugi - Keys, she's a literal angel for real / Azusa - Guitar, VERY COMMITED NOT KIDDING</h5>
					<p>The music fucking slaps and the animations looks fucking gorgeous.
					<br>Also I noticed the way they play their instruments is drawn correctly! Guitar, bass, piano AND drums. Huge respect.<br><br>
						<div>
							<img src="pics/anime/kon.gif" width=720 height=auto class="shadow-thingy"/>
						</div>
					<br>Also my fav character is Ritsu, she's a dummy. 9/10</p>

			<hr class="rounded">

				<h2>Initial D</h2>
					<h4>*Eurobeat Intensifies*</h4>
					<p>Here we following the story of a young cute male, Takumi Fujiwara, who drives his father's Toyota Trueno to deliver tofu to some hotel lost in god knows where.
					<br>The thing is, Takukumi isn't your ordinary UPS delivery guy...</p>
						<div>
							<img src="https://media.tenor.com/ceRw7O2NH90AAAAM/022106-tofushop.gif" width=480 height=auto class="shadow-thingy"/>
						</div>
					<p>Turns out Takumi is a very experienced driver and has been drifting on the roads of Mount Akina since he was fucking 13.
					<br>The funny thing is that Takumi dislikes racing, the dude is only trying to do his job.
					<br>The problem is that he's WAAAAY too good at doing it and that attracts the attention of numerous street racers.
					<br>Soon enough Takumi is challenged to race against all kinds of people driving all kinds of cars: RX-7, Skyline GTR, a fucking Civic, Lan Evo, Impreza... You name it!</p>
						<div>
							<img src="https://media.tenor.com/rt1Nr6kjzAsAAAAd/initial-d-takumi.gif" class="shadow-thingy"/>
						</div>
					<p>Over time, Takumi begins to like racing and he comes up with wacky ways to race and overtake his competition.
					<br>Dude isn't even afraid of redlining his Trueno, he's got a neat little car and he's pushing it to the max!
					<br>I FORGOT TO MENTION THE MUSIC. Eurobeat fucking slaps. This anime got me into Eurobeat and it has become one of my favourite genres of all time.</p>

						</div>
					<p>It's funny and exciting. I give this anime a solid 9/10</p>
					
			<hr class="rounded">

				<h2>Your Lie in April</h2>
					<h4>Made me cry</h4>
					<p>Here we're following the story of two high schoolers: Kousei, who's a fucking great pianists,
					<br>and Kaori, who's a literal angel playing the violin and emanates extreme chaotic energy.
					<br>The thing is, both of them have to deal with severe traumas, past and future. They both connect musically and spiritually to escape from said traumas.
					<br>Actually, I don't think I'm doing enough justice to both these characters... Kousei is a fucking machine, if you give him a sheet of music he's going to play it 100% accurately.</p>
						<div>
							<img src="https://media.tenor.com/gJQbX57mhTEAAAAC/your-lie-in-april-piano.gif" width=480 height=auto class="shadow-thingy"/>
						</div>
					<p>Kaori is the complete opposite, she'll eventually make her own stuff up.
					<br>DON'T GET ME WRONG, she's fucking amazing at playing the violin, gives it a fuck ton of emotion and IT FITS SO WELL.</p>
						<div>
							<img src="https://media.tenor.com/IDKo3W5o1gEAAAAC/your-lie-in-april-violin.gif" width=480 height=auto class="shadow-thingy"/>
						</div>
					<p>The problem is that... Actually, I'll let you figure out the rest of the anime since it's hard NOT to spoiler anything!
					<br>The animation is beautiful as fuck and the music... I'm not a classical listener, but the pieces here make me want to headbang to the point my neck disjoints lmao
					<br>Just like K-On, the way they play their instruments is drawn correctly, which is an amazing feat considering the type of music played here.</p>
						<div>
							<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/eb/6c/cb/eb6ccbb8bf9289bcabdb446f733cfab0.gif" width=480 height=auto class="shadow-thingy"/>
						</div>
					<p>If you want to see a nice little tear jerker anime I recommend watching this one. I give it a well deserved 9/10.</p>
            
			<hr class="rounded">

				<h2>A Silent Voice</h2>
					<h4>Was beautiful</h4>
            
            <hr class="rounded">

				<h2>Look Back</h2>
					<h4>Manga Drawing Duo makes me sad</h4>
			
			<hr class="rounded">
					
				<h2>Girls' Last Tour</h2>
					<h4>Two girls travelling an empty world</h4>

			<hr class="rounded">

				<h2>Neon Genesis Evangelion</h2>
					<h4>...What the hell happened here???</h4>
					<p>Alright so here we're following the story of a kid, Shinji Ikari, who is totally not severely depressed and totally doesn't have parent issues not at all!</p>
						<div>
							<img src="https://media0.giphy.com/media/OpYV9CBVZOb1S/giphy.gif" class="shadow-thingy"/>
						</div>
					<p>....Maybe just a little.</p>
					<p>GOD DAMN IT from where do I even start... So the earth is fucked, there's been a second impact (first one being the funny dinosaurs meteor) and half the earth population is fucked.
					<br>And on top of all, there are these creatures called "Angels" and they want to fuck up earth even further.
					<br>Shinji feels obligated to prevent a third impact from happening, so he fights these aliens using an "Eva" which is kind of like a gigantic organic robotic mess of a thing.
						<div>
							<img src="https://gifdb.com/images/high/evangelion-unit-01-run-6hlbhudlgkzc0uei.gif" class="shadow-thingy"/>
						</div>
					<br>AND ON TOP OF ALL HE has to live with this chick that likes to drink beer and has a pet penguin. Very funny and not at all depressing!<br><br>
						<div>
							<img src="pics/anime/penpen.gif" class="shadow-thingy"/>
						</div>
					<br>On a serious note, there's really no way to explain the mind-fuckery going on in this anime.
					<br>Best you can do is watch it yourself. OH YEAH 9/10  [That also includes "The End of Evangelion" and all the "You Can (Not)" movies].</p>

				<h2>Watamote</h2>
					<h4>Discord girl with no friends is forced to go outside and touch some grass</h4>

						</div>
					<p>Our protagonist is Tomoko: Weirdo ass girl, VERY introverted and has EXTREME social anxiety.</p>
						<div>
							<img src="pics/anime/tomoko.gif" width=480 height=auto; class="shadow-thingy"/>
						</div>
					<p>She went on her life to somehow fuck everything up, hell she couldn't even properly talk to the only friend she had.
					<br>Bitch went so crazy once she started talking to herself in the mirror.
					<br>Alright maybe I'm being WAY too harsh on the poor girl. AT LEAST she's trying to become a better person, and surprisingly she's succeeding at it...
					<br>In the on-going manga ofc.
						<div>
							<img src="pics/anime/mokochi.webp" width=720 height=auto class="shadow-thingy"/>
						</div>
					<br>Apparently people didn't like the anime when it first aired because "tHaT DoeSn'T rEfleCt pEoplE wIth soCiaL anXieTy aT aLL" like go watch Komi or smth.
					<br>As I was saying, the girl actually goes on to overcome her extreme social anxiety and makes a fuck ton of friends.
					<br>She literally went from being a loner to a Harem protagonist fr.</p>
						<div>
							<img src="pics/anime/tomokofriends.png" class="shadow-thingy"/>
						</div>
					<p>Ah fuck we're here to talk about the anime, right... Even as cringy as this can get, I really like this fucking piece of anime.
					<br>It can get relatable at times and I don't know how to feel about that. 7/10
					<br>I hope they make a season 2 of the anime because her character development in the manga is really fucking beautiful. ❤️</p>

				<h2>Bocchi the Rock!</h2>
					<h4>What if K-On and Watamote had a child?</h4>

			<hr class="rounded">

				<h2>Serial Experiments Lain</h2>
					<h4>This fucking thing is fucking weird istg</h4>
							<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d7/64/84/d76484f755763b87d45ec9c56e21b37c.gif" width=480 height=auto; class="shadow-thingy"/>
					<p>In a nutshell, Lain is a very awkward girl and her father is the embodiment of 🤓 jkjk let me start again<br><br>
						
							<img src="pics/anime/laindad.webp" width=240px height=auto/>
						
					<br>Lain recieves an email from a student that commited suicide not too long ago.
					<br>Turns out, the chick that commited suicide wasn't 100% dead since she transfered her consciousness or some shit to The Wired (The Internet but way more bizarre).
					<br>Lain starts to become more interested in computer stuff and gets caught up in some weird ass events and a bunch of cryptic shit.<br><br>
							<img src="https://animesher.com/orig/0/68/689/6891/animesher.com_serial-experiments-lain-iwakura-lain-gif-689117.gif"  width=480 height=auto; class="shadow-thingy"/>
					<br>Soon enough we find out that the line that separates The Wired and real life beggins to dissapear and a bunch of shit occurs and I don't understand this anime.
					<br>Also, the opening gives me extreme nostalgia for some reason.<br><br>
						<div>

						</div>
					<br>The artstyle is unique as fuck and the music has this mysterious and weird aura that I love, overall I give it an 8/10.<br><br></p>

					<p>So here we're following the story of a young hot male who recently acquired a very special Nissan Fairlady S30Z... Also Known as The Devil Z.
					<br>It is said that the people who drive The Devil Z fall under its curse and end up getting in strange accidents...
					<br>Well I say that the dude who tuned the car must have smoked a blunt or two.
					<br>OFC our young hot male, Akio, doesn't give a fuck about that and tries to drive the Z as fast as possible (probably against his own will).</p>
						<div>
							<img src="https://c.tenor.com/jiR-fAyy1wkAAAAC/wangan-midnight-racing.gif" width=640px; height=auto class="shadow-thingy"/>
						</div>
					<p>He tries to compete with a heavily modified Porsche 911 Turbo driven by a doctor, who was previously friends with the past owner of the Devil Z.
					<br>Also there's a Nissan Skyline GTR driven by a TV Hoster and a Ferrari Testarossa driven by a photographer.
					<br>Really shows that it doesn't matter what your profession is, no one is stopping you from driving dangerously fast cars!</p>
						<div>
							<img src="https://c.tenor.com/fHY0X5vXsVEAAAAd/wangan-midnight.gif" class="shadow-thingy"/>
						</div>
					<p>The OST slaps and the animation was made by the same studio that produced Initial D Fourth Stage, so if you loved Initial D you'll probably like this one too.
					<br>Overall I give it a neat 7/10</p>
