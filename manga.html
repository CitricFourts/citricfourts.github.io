	<h1>I like manga</h1>
		<p>wow very surprising</p>
			<h3>ANYWAYS here's my (Work in Progress) very very small list on probably all the manga I've read yet!</h3>

			<hr class="rounded">

				<h2>Love Me For Who I Am</h2>
					<h4>Non-binary creature makes friends at a femboy maid cafe</h4>
					<p>We start by following the life of some random ass guy (Tetsu) getting some groceries.
					<br>Yes very interesting I know, anyways he suddenly spots one of his classmates:
					<br>Mogumo, a non-binary character that wishes to have "friends who will understand me".</p>

					<p>Tetsu offers Mogumo to work at "Question!" a Maid cafe his trans sister owns.
					<br>Mogumo is like "Ay maid outfits are so fucking cute" so they accept the offer and get to work at the cafe.
					<br>The cafe consists of femboys dressing up with maid outfits, so Tetsu thinks it would be the perfect job for Mogumo.
					<br>(Tetsu thought that Mogumo identified themselves as a male)</p>

					<p>When Tetsu and Mogumo arrive at the cafe, everyone thinks that Mogumo looks super cute as a "Girlyboy".
					<br>Damn did that tickle someone off. Mogumo proceeds to explain that they do not identify as male nor female.
					<br>The staff members don't understand the logic behind that and they have a little argument, but Tetsu's sis has had enough shit and explains what's going on.</p>

					<p>This causes several existential crisis and the staff members re-think what they all know about gender.
					<br>wow I'm being so fucking slow ANYWAYS the staff accepts Mogumo the way they are and one of the staff members reconsiders being a girl
					<br>They all get to know so much LGBT stuff it's unbelievable. Of course, not everyone understands the concept of LGBT, and not everything is happiness.</p>
					
						<img src="pics/manga/lgbt.png" width=480 height=auto; class="shadow-thingy"/>
						
					<BR>WOW THAT TOOK A REALLY DARK TURN anyways the manga is mostly comedic and funny but it does have it's dark/sad moments here and there.
					<br>I think it really shows well what some people might feel like about their gender. I give it an 8/10.
					<br>Ending could have been better and the story could have been expanded a bit more but overall it was a really nice read.</p>
