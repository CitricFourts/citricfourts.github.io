<p><br><i><h1><p><font color="red">I'M STRESSED</font></p></h1></i></br></p>
<p>I used to consider myself a happy person. Someone without worries in life.
<br>"Â¿What happened? Â¿Why did you say 'used to'? Â¿Is it because electricity bills are higher than usual now?"
<br>Yeah that's one of the main reasons, but it's not the only one....</p>

<p>A couple days ago I woke up really stressed, decided to drink some coffee because that usually calms me down.
<br>So I went to my kitchen to make myself some coffee using a NESPRESSO machine, but to my absolute deception I realized that the NESPRESSO machine, that my Uncle in law that died yelling in front of his mother at new year's eve gave me, had just had to break.
<br>No worries yet. A friend of mine knew about NESPRESSO and told me to buy a new NESPRESSO machine.
<br>Alright, we're making some progress now!. So I went to NESPRESSO's webpage to buy A COFFEE MACHINE, <u>ABSOLUTE MISTAKE.</u></p>

<p>Â¿Do I buy the "Original" or the "Vertuo"? Â¿What's the difference between both, and which one is the newest?
<br>Â¿Is Obama still the president? Â¿Was communism a good idea?<p>

<p>I didn't want to lose my head so I clicked "Original". Worst mistake of my life.
<br>I just wanted a damn coffee machine Â¿What is an Inissia? It sounds like "Initiate" BUT THEN THERE'S  "Essenza" which sounds like "Essence".
<br>This is bad, i'm a heavy overthinker and I'm already losing my mind...
<br>Then I realized that there was more stuff.
<br>Plus, all these coffee machines didn't have support to add milk. I like milk.
<br>I scrolled down a little bit and saw the CitiZ & Milk, Lattissima One, Lattissima Pro and Gran Lattissima.</p>

<p>I'm <u>dissapointed</u> with Nespresso..
<br>Why is it so damn hard TO CHOOSE A DAMN COFFE MACHINE?
<br>You know what? Screw the "Original", what about the "Vertuo"?</p>

<img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1072637037741613106/1072646626486779904/image.png?width=345&height=676"/>

<p>Aight let me be straight. Â¿What the HELL is going on here? Â¿What's the difference between Vertuo Next Deluxe and la Next Premium? Â¿Plus Deluxe D? Â¿Plus Deluxe C?
<br>Â¿Do they support milk or will I have to make my own manly boy milk?
<br>Â¿And what's the deal with Limited Editions? Â¿Does it change the functionality or is it purely aesthetic?
<br>Hold on a second...</p>

<p>OH GOD THEY HAVE ORIGINAL AND VERTUO CAPSULES TOO
<br>NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br>
<br>Â¿Do they work the same way or are they different? Â¿Will I have to buy a  Vertuo Deluxe Premium D Lattissima One capsule just for one machine?
<br>BUT THAT AIN'T ALL<br>

<p>VERTUO MUGS ðŸ˜­
<br>Does this mean that if I try to drink "Original" coffee with a "Vertuo" mug then all the coffee vaporizes?
<br>I give up.</p>

<p>At the end, between all the despair, I ended up drinking 3 bottles of Tabasco, 7 redbull cans and 2 lines of coke.
<br>Died from cardiac arrest. Don't care. They already have a NESPRESSO machine here in hell. I'm happy.</p>
