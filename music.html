	<h2 style="color:white">Work in progress stuff!</h2>
		<p>I have NO IDEA if I'm allowed to post this here but HERE ARE some demos of SHIT I'M CURRENTLY WORKING ON!! :D</p>
			<div style="color:white">

		<h2>MY GEAR!!!</h2>
			<p>I'm not a rich boi by all means so I have to make use of cheap stuff and shit my parents used to have back in the 80's SOOO</p><br>

				<img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/643097163408080910/1042432471666528256/IMG_20221116_143116.jpg" width=50% height=auto/><br>

			<p><strong>My soundcard</strong> is a Behringer U-Phoria UM2. Good for beginner producers, but it adds some kind of hiss that I don't like and the headroom is kind of meh.</p>

			<p><strong>My microphone</strong> is a NEEWER NW-800. Again, good for beginners and shit but the frequency response kinda sucks, plus it sounds dark as fuck.
			<br>It needs phantom power; not that it's a bad thing but you're gonna have to search for a soundcard or an external source that can power microphones that require it.</p>

			<p><strong>My keyboard</strong> is a swissonic EasyKey 49. It's a neat little keyboard, it's got a pitch wheel, a mod wheel, a slider and a knob.
			<br>THE THING IS, it's not weighted and the slider stopped working just a couple months ago. Plus one of the keys is starting to harden for some fucking reason???</p>

			<p><strong>The speakers</strong> are Technics EH750, my mother's old stereo. I don't actually use them for mixing nor mastering, I only use them as reference as to how my shit would translate to the real world.
			<br>Plus it's got a lot of EQ options too. If I wanted to properly mix and shit I would use...</p>

			<p><strong>My headphones,</strong> AKG K702. Probably the best piece of gear I have rn. Openback headphones, <i>almost</i> neutral frequency response, wide soundstage...
			<br>The only bad thing is that it lacks a ton of sub, but overall they're pretty amazing.</p>

			<p><strong>My other headphones,</strong> Superlux HD 662, my first "proper" set of headphones.
			<br>I say "proper" because all the past headphones I had were either a fucking muddy sub mess or straight up all mids and the Superlux at least attempt to be flat, but they've still got a fuck ton of sub. Still useful at some occasions.</p>

		<h3>GUITARS!!!!</h3>
			
				<img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/643097163408080910/1042443659934715954/IMG_20221116_151525.jpg" width=50% height=auto/><br>

			<p><strong>Santander (Strat copy). </strong>Fun fact, this guitar was a gift from the brother, of the husband, of my step-sister. Weirdass family trees ik.
			<br>Anyways this was the first proper guitar I've ever played. I've practiced a fuck ton of stuff with it. Kickass guitar, except the highs suck and if you play loudly the pickups distort...
			<br>Another fun fact, I once broke the volume knob by hitting it too hard while recording Lost Freedom's Rythm guitar. I couldn't use the thing for months, but it's already been repaired.</p>

			<p><strong>Daytona (Les Paul copy). </strong>First guitar I bought with my own money, mainly out of impulse because when I saw it I thought "OWOAH IT'S YUI'S GUITAR FROM K-ON!!!"
			<br>Anyways it sounds dark as fuck, which can be good if you're recording some heavy shit with it. Talking about heavy, this guitar weighs a fuck ton.
			<br>Also, you've probably seen this guitar a couple times in my youtube channel. Recorded a ton of shit with it, not disappointed.</p>
			
			<p><strong>OQAN 16 GB??? </strong>No fucking idea why they decided to name it that way but I find it funny. This acoustic guitar was a gift from my grandma btw.
			<br>ANYWAYS it sounds (again) dark as fuck, which combined with my NEEWER microphone means that I have to boost the treble by like fucking 30dB.
			<br>Apart from that, it's a neat little acoustic guitar and I've recorded a fuck ton of shit with it.</p>

<h1> TIPS AND TRICKS!!!</h1>

<h2>The Random Ideas Folder</h2>
<p>This one has saved my ass several times istg
<br>Basically, everytime I get inspired (I come up with a melody or something) I quickly record it using my guitar or a piano and I save it in a "Random Ideas" folder
<br>So in the case I'm working on a cool track and I don't know what else to do, I just jump on that random ideas folder, choose something and slap it in my track
<br>Within a couple months (or years) you'll have a big ass arsenal of shit you can choose from.
