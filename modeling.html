	<h1>I like to make my PC suffer</h1>
				
		<h2>Usually when I get bored of producing a song I jump into Blender and try to do some 3D stuff.
		<br>Now, I suck at modelling so I just keep it simple and make weird scenes and shit</h2>

		<hr class="rounded">

			<div>
				<p>Some time ago I was into a bunch of liminal stuff because it made me feel weird and nostalgic
				<br>so one day I decided to make some kind of "liminal parking lot" and I did this... thing?</p>
				<img src="./3drenders/parkinglot.jpg" width=1280 height=auto; class="shadow-thingy"/>
				<p>It feels ominous and I like it. Will probably make more of these in the future</p>
			</div>
			
		<hr class="rounded">
			<div>
				<p>I was playing this GMOD map (gm_liminal_space) and I found a room that looked interesting to me.
				<br>It kinda resembled one of those "liminal pool" renders you usually see on youtube or reddit.</p>
				<img src="./3drenders/liminalpool.png" width=1280 height=auto; class="shadow-thingy"/>
				<p>Modelling this was a pain in the ass, I tried so hard to make a good water simulation but I just coudln't.
				<br>The water isn't real, it's a glossy plane with a noise texture as displacement map. Does the trick, very poorly though.</p>
			</div>
			
		<hr class="rounded">
				
			<div>
				<p>I was playing this other GMOD map (gm_rain) and found a scene that I really liked so I decided to make this...
				<br>Weird fantasy park that is purple for some reason?</p>
				<img src="./3drenders/walkinthepark.png" width=1280 height=auto; class="shadow-thingy"/>
				<p>I never got to finish this one, ran out of ideas. I'll probably continue it in the future</p>
			</div>
			
		<hr class="rounded">
		
			<div>
				<p>There's also this Slaughterhouse looking ass corridor I based of another GMOD map (gm_pool) while also taking inspiration from the Saw movies.</p>
				<img src="./3drenders/slaughterhouse22.png" width=1280 height=auto; class="shadow-thingy"/>
				<p>It looks disgusting as shit. That thing on the wall isn't blood btw, it's just me not knowing how to make moss.</p>
			</div>
			
		<hr class="rounded">
		
			<div>
				<p>This one was a pain in the ass to make and it isn't even complete yet.
				<br>I wanted to make some kind of creepy old elevator scene for a game
				<br>but as you can see I failed horribly lmao</p>
				<img src="./3drenders/elecato.png" width=1280 height=auto; class="shadow-thingy"/>
				<p>I'll probably try to finish it, or at least improve it in the future.</p>
			</div>
			
		<hr class="rounded">
		
			<div>
				<p>This one is an old concept for a game I used to be involved with.</p>
				<img src="./3drenders/painsuffering.png" width=1280 height=auto; class="shadow-thingy"/>
				<p>I wanted to make an anime styled 90s home studio bedroom thingy but it doesn't look very anime nor 90s.
				<br>I had to model the majority of the synths myself since I couldn't find any free alternatives online.
				<br>Ignore the overwhelming amount of bad details like the laptop clipping into the cortains and the fire hazard going on under the desk lmao</p>
				
			</div>
			
		<hr class="rounded">
		
			<div>
				<p>I usually like the renders people make for VSTs so I decided to make one myself.
				<br>This one is based off the 1176 compressor which is popular (and expensive) as fuck.</p>
				<img src="./3drenders/117comp_bts.png" width=1280 height=auto; class="shadow-thingy"/>
				<p>It turned out fucking horrible horrible looking lmao
				<br>I ended up using this one as <a href="./immigrantaudio">Immigrant Audio's 117 COMPRESSOR</a></p>
				<p>There's also this other one I did 2 or 3 months later</p>
				<img src="./3drenders/117compV2.png" width=1280 height=auto; class="shadow-thingy"/>
				<p>Can you believe it actually looks usable?
				<br>But wait! There are more compressors!</p>
				<img src="./3drenders/xxlgspot.png" width=auto height=720; class="shadow-thingy"/>
				<p>Ok that's cool and all but where are the equalize-</p>
				<img src="./3drenders/immitec.png" width=1280 height=auto; class="shadow-thingy"/>
				<p>Fuck ok, but you still need speake-</p>
				<img src="./3drenders/blj.png" width=1280 height=auto; class="shadow-thingy"/>
				<p>ðŸ’€</p>
				<p>There's also this Birotron (a very rare and unique sampler from the 70s) model I rendered using the Eevee Engine for the first time.</p>
				<img src="./3drenders/birob90.png" width=1280 height=auto; class="shadow-thingy"/>
				<p>Also used for an Immigrant Audio joke, though I changed the name to v-Tron to avoid confusion (and legal issues..)</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<p>I've recently gotten interested in those very old 90s CGI scenes.
				<br>I don't know why, they just look so uncannily cool! Tried making one myself and...</p>
				<img src="./3drenders/fruta.gif" width=720 height=auto; class="shadow-thingy"/>
				<p>well it doesnt look cool at all but at least the feeling is still there</p>
				<p>There's also this other version done in Bryce 7</p>
				<img src="./3drenders/fl jumpscare.gif" width=720 height=auto; class="shadow-thingy"/>
				<p>And this depressing ass tree my friend LeFidoot used for one of her album arts</p>
				<img src="./3drenders/tree.jpg" width=720 height=auto; class="shadow-thingy"/>
				<p>And this weird apocalyptic musical video thing that was inspired by a dream I had</p>
				<img src="./3drenders/lain.gif" width=720 height=auto; class="shadow-thingy"/>
				<h4>I SEE</h4>
				<img src="./3drenders/I see.jpg" width=720 height=auto; class="shadow-thingy"/>
				<h4>I thought the pre-rendered backgrounds from Ocarina of Time looked cool so I tried making one...</h4>
				<img src="./3drenders/fuente bryce fin2.png" width=720 height=auto; class="shadow-thingy"/>
				<p>...Guess I still have a long way to go lmao</p>
				<img src="./3drenders/fljumpscare2.gif" width=720 height=auto; class="shadow-thingy"/>
				<p>By the way, if hell had a 3D modelling program, it would be Bryce
				<br>The controls are so fucking <strong>CLUNKY</strong> that writing the entire Holy Bible with a flip phone seems like a less painful torture in comparison</p>
				<h3>I'll probs keep making more of these janky renders in the future</h3>

			<p>That's it. I just wasted your time by making you look at my half-assed renders.
			<br>Please don't throw chairs at me, someone from my class threw a chair lit on fire at me and it wasn't a good experience for the love of GOD PLEASE DON'T TTHORW CHAIRS AT ME TNEIRHNE RTKIANBE IEFKGJNGOIHNAJBOOFDHN</P>
